Here, I required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. I worked with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz 
car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. I used XGBoost algorithm which contributed to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without
reducing Mercedes-Benzâ€™s standards.
